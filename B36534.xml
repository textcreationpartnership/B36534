            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And alwaies there shall be as many ranckes in all after .21. to a rancke, as are thr√©e times so manye as the roote is of, whiche is, thr√©e times .63. whiche comes to 189. so that .189. ranckes of men shal be the number ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of after .21. to a rancke. And by the roote that is .63. you may vnderstande that suche deuision is to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene .63. and .63. so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the firste shall be as well .63. part as also the seconde and the thirde. In whiche deuisions the twoo double ranckes of Harkabutters are to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the redier knowledge to bring them into a square battell. But if in deuiding the roote into thr√©e, there shoulde remayne .1. ouerplus, as shoulde happen if the presupposed men were .5776. the roote whereof being 76. whiche roote deuided into .3. shall come vnto .25. and one to remayne ouerplus. Nowe I saye, that all the ranckes that riseth of these men, shall be notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thr√©e times so manye as the roote, that is three times .76. which makes .228. And for as muche as all
<pb facs="tcp:176553:6"/> these orders of ranckes, are deuided euermore into .3. partes (as before hath bene declared) .76. ranckes to ƒÅ parte (that is so many as the roote is of) therefore it is to be vnderstande, that the firste and the laste of these thr√©e partes muste bee made to marche .25. men in a rancke, whiche is as muche as is the thirde parte of the roote, and for that there remayneth one ouerplus (as aboue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) I saye that the same one muste b√©e put alwaies in the seconde parte, whiche is in the middeste, I meane causing those of the saide seconde parte, to marche .26. menne in a rancke, so that the firste and the last part of the greate rewe of ranckes, be .25. men in a rancke, and the second parte to b√©e .26. men in a rancke, and the very same ought to be done of euery other roote that may be deuided into thr√©e, where onely remaineth ouerplus one but when there remainethe ouerplus .2. it followeth, cleane contrary: For that the firste and the laste parte would be of one mƒÅ more, thƒì the same that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> third part of the roote is of. As for example if the saide men were 2809. the roote whereof is .53. whiche deuided into thr√©e, coomes to .71. and .2. remayning ouerplus: therefore of so many menne, there shall b√©e made .159. ranckes (that is thr√©e times .53.) whiche .159. ranckes deuiding them also into thr√©e partes commeth vnto .53. to a parte, that is the number of the roote. And the firste and thirde parte woulde be of one man more then the thirde parte of the roote, that is, it would be of .18. menne to a rancke, and the seconde parte, whiche is the parte in the middest, woulde be the verye thirde parte of the roote: that is, 17. menne to a rancke, so that of all the .159. ranckes, as wel the first .53. ranckes, as likewise the last .53. ranckes oughte to be of .18, men to a rancke, and the .53. ranckes in the middeste woulde be onely of .17. men to a rancke And, wherein parting the roote into .3. there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethe ouerplus onelye one, it goeth cleane contrarye to this. For that the fyrste and the thirde parte of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176553:6"/> sayde great rew of ranckes, will alwaies be of as many men to a rancke as shalbe the whole thirde parte of the roote, and the middle parte, whiche is the second, will bee of one man more then the thirde parte of the roote. And for as muche, as there can neuer remayne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus aboue one or twoo in deuiding the roote into thr√©e, therfore this foresayde rule shall serue in what nomber of men so euer it b√©e, as well Quadrante as not Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drante, for that like as before is sayde in nombers not Quadrante, alwayes there is taken the roote whiche goeth n√©erest to suche a nomber, and therewith to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as aboue hath bene sayed. And as for the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the men that c≈çmeth to be ouerplus of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drante of such a roote, maye be placed some other where as shall be thoughte moste beste. For example if there were foure thousande men, which nomber is not Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drante, yet notwithstanding of the same nomber there oughte to be taken oute the n√©erest roote therof, whiche is lxiii. so that there shall remayne ouerplus one and thirtie men, whome minding in a suddaine to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fouresquare battayle, there oughte to be putte in a rancke. lxiii. men, and suche a battayle shall come to b√©e fowersquare, as in the beginning hath b√©ene sayde: and where there remaynes ouerplus those .31. men, the Sergiant may place thƒì as he shal thinke good. Likewise minding to cause those 4000. men to march, there ought also to be taken the n√©erest roote therof, which as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde, is .63. which deuiding into thr√©e, comes vnto thr√©e times 21. &amp; nothing remayning ouerplus. And therefore the sayde men ought to b√©e caused to marche .xxi. in a ranke, &amp; the sayde rancke to be deuided into thr√©e parts. lxiii. to a rancke according to the foresayde rule, in suche sorte that the last parte shalbe .64. ranckes, and also .10. men more because of those .31. men that were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus in the beginning, the whiche as hathe b√©ene sayde remayned oute of the araye: And after the same maner,

               <p>Therfore the more that they be made distaunte from those bulwarkes (the due length of the curtin being kept) so much the blunter the corners will come to b√©e, which by them must be defended, and the more of those corners that there are in the same fashion, so muche the blunter they shall also come to b√©e. So that where the fashion of the places that are builte bee sufficiente great to contayne all the foresayde particulars, whiche for a sure fortresse is requisite to b√©e made, all thing commodiously will come to passe: and the greater that
<pb facs="tcp:176553:17"/> they shalbe, the more men they maye haue to defend them and more commodious space within, for to retire with greate and strong fortification, and the platformes maye be made muche further in, and haue the corners of theyr bulwarkes blunt, and with a large backe, m√©ete for defence, and in an assaulte, muche surer then the sharpe, because the sharpe poincted bulwarke, being battered defendeth the enemye from the platformes, so that vnder the same, being couered, he maye almost oute of daunger, make an assaulte. Where against a Towne or Fortresse, that were builte after the fashion of these plattes folowing, in what so euer parte of such places, the enemy should approche marching towardes them to incampe, or in battell raie to assaulte them, or with Trenches, and artillery to batter them, either high or lowe or by the curtin within, or otherwise, he shall alwaies, from many of those flankers of the same place, be greately hurte and repulced, and of the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes in especially, more then from any other where, because they be moste neere, and stande higher then all the other, and they shall also hurte him more, when he shall b√©e somewhat farre of, then n√©ere hande, as maye be sene by the plaine platte that hath the number .1. and in the same that is raised vp, that hath the number .2.</p>
               <p>The whiche with twoo other are also here after pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to the ende that thereby maye be considered of such as shall s√©e them, the sundrye good and notable effectes that b√©e in them, the whiche althoughe it b√©e not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible so easelye with writing to b√©e expressed, yet by theyr helpe they maye be better vnderstande and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and moreouer by them shalbe gotten this knowledge, whereby euery man commodiously maye vnderstande, where the enemie gowing aboute with his power, maye best deuise to assaile them, and howe they within maye prouide to defende and withstand the same with theyr men, taking them from those places
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176553:17"/> where they may best be spared, so y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> building the fashi≈ç of fortresses, in the saide maner, there shall in no place happen any such incommodities, as in other that are ignorauntly made, after the ordinary fashion with lesse corners, as also by these figures, here folowing is more plainlye declared.</p>
               <p>There oughte also to be noted, that these and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plattes, in this treatise set foorth, being drawen in a litle space, coulde not b√©e fashioned with their due proportion: albeit to the ende that same which is reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about them, might partly b√©e vnderstande, they are not left out or omitted: for without their help it shoulde haue bene impossible for anye man, to haue comprehƒì<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that, which I s√©eke to declare, concerning fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although they were expert souldiours: as by the foresayde plattes of the nombre of 1. and 2. maye mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlye b√©e s√©ene, howe well the courteynes of suche a towne, is by the bulwarkes therof defended, and howe the ditches of the platformes, and of both of them are flancked and skowred, besides other thinges, whiche by the lines that are drawen be declared, where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it coulde not b√©e shewed after such sorte, as it might b√©e vnderstande, and the like happeneth in the other.</p>

               <p>There now remained to be c≈çsidered, what fashi≈ç is to be iudged of moste perfection, either the same whiche without any edification placed in the middest of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin therof, shalbe builded, or that which shal haue either caualiers, or platformes, or what so euer other maner of edification or figure, that for to defende the cortins of the bulwarkes may be placed: or whether it be of those fashi≈çs, which vnto this present hath bene vsed of other in buylding, or some new maner that might be deuised Therefore in this part leauing to reason of those, that shall haue caualiers or platformes as also of those bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes that the cortins shall haue, which from the one to the other moste straightlye without other edification placed in the middest do shoote, for this time I shall only shewe a newe fashion, the which I iudge to be the most perfectest, that is possible to be imagined, as maye b√©e s√©ene by the lines y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are drawen from the plaine plat of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> n≈´ber of 3. &amp; by the plat that is raised vp of the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

And whereas they maye be builded with lesse coste then otherwise, they haue also commoditie to make their gates equallye distante the one from the other, from the nexte bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes: where they are placed moste safelie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouslie with greate strengthe, and those gates be as
<pb facs="tcp:176553:20"/> well, as all the reste of the wall, and greatlier in that parte, much surer from the assailing of the enemies, thƒì in what so euer other maner of fashion mighte be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: for as muche as the platforms, and caualiers b√©e no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so strong, but more easie to b√©e ouerthrowen, in respecte to this maner of building, which is moste sure from such daunger, and excedingly well defended from the force of the enemie: to the which, the nerer that the enemie shall approche, so much the more he shal of those within be hurt, c≈çtrarie to that, which in the platformes happeneth. Moreouer there maye be certayne slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houses builte in the diche, as in the plat of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of .4. by the letters <hi>.F.H.</hi> is shewed, which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> enemies with greate difficultie must firste s√©eke to winne, before they can come nere the walles. And those being wonne, shall be but small preiudise to the towne or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse: wherefore without comparison, this fashion is greatelier to bee praised, then the same with platformes for that the nerer the Walle, the enemie shall come, soo much more from the bulwarkes by flanke, and all most on the backe, and from other places, both by flanke, and by fronte in one instant, he shalbe hurte and stroken.</p>
               <p>Where also in suche a kinde of fashion with many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the greatenes and roome of the towne within, is somwhat deminished, in respect to those that are made with platformes. Therefore I conclude, for the consideracions a foresaide, these to b√©e the moste perfectest fashions that any strong fortresse, is possible to b√©e made.</p>

Besides this, there muste be made a furnes with one or .ij. caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of brasse walled thereon, whiche muste be as greate as those that the Diers vse, and these cauldrons muste then be filled, with the foresaide Saltepeter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the whiche (as alredie I haue tolde) oughte to be as full of substaunce as maie be, so that it haue aboute the .ij. third partes, and make it faire and softlie to boile so much till it come to one thirde part, or there aboutes: and after take it of, and put it to settell in a greate ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, couered, whiche muste be well bounde aboute, with hoopes of yron, and sure and close in the ioyning thereof, to the intente it spill not: and thus when the same water is setled and well clarefied, and from the yearthe and grose matter, whiche in it remained, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently purged, it muste be taken oute and boyled againe of newe in the same cauldron, or in some other: and for as muche as euerye time that it boileth, if it be not taken h√©ede of, it turneth into skum, and sometimes swelleth so muche, that often times running ouer it spilleth, and carrieth awaye therewith muche of the good: the whiche minding to rem√©edie, you muste take thr√©e partes of Oke asshes, and one of lime, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, in euerie hundrethe pounde waighte of water, there muste be dissolued fower pounde of roche Alum: and when the cauldron boileth, take of the sayde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a pot, and powre into it ones or twise, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially when you s√©e the Saltepeter water rise in skum, whiche in a little while you shall s√©e it alaie, bothe clere
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176553:26"/> and faire, and of an azur colour: and it muste b√©e boyled so long, till all the thinne watrinesse b√©e vapored away and the substaunce of the Saltpeter thickened: so that it being taken out, and put in chestes or tubbes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, maye congeale: the whiche is best done, when the water is brought to least quantitie, taking it out and putting it into a lesse caudron, wherein it will sooner congeale: the whiche water being tasted, and s√©ene to b√©e brought to suche passe, to b√©e reade to congeale, you maye take it out, and put it in vesselles of wood, or of earth that are rough within, with certayne stickes of wood, to congeale, and so you shall let it coole, and rest. iij. or iiij. daies, so as it maye drop, and be strayned through some litle hole, in the bottom of the vessell: and all the water that is not then congealed, you must take out and saue for to s√©eth againe: and the Saltpeter that is in anye quantitie congealed, you shall finde to b√©e, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vertue that was in the water, or in the earth: but the clerenesse and fairnesse thereof, will come of the maister vertue of the water, that is put into it in the boyling, which hath strength to purgeit, and make it come, as it were refined in the first s√©ething: nowe this being taken from the sides of the vessell, where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, and in the water therof washed, you must laye it vpon a table to drie throughlye: and the same s√©eming vnto you to haue n√©ede, or neuerthelesse minding to haue it aboue the common vse, for some purpose, more purefied, &amp; without earthy grosnesse, &amp; altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fatnesse and saltnesse, whiche for to make exc√©eding fine pouder, or <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> is most requisit so to be: to be short, for what so euer cause it oughte to be refined, I councell you, to do it after one of these ij. wayes, whiche here following, I shall teach you. The first, which I like best, is with water: and the seconde is with fire, with water it is refined in this maner, taking of the foresaid mixture made of lime, asshes, and allome dissolued: and
<pb facs="tcp:176553:27"/> then for euerie barrell of water that you haue put in the cauldron, for to disolue the Saltepeter, you muste put into it sixe pottefulls of the foresayd strong water: and in the same quantitie of water so prepared, put so muche Saltpeter as you thinke maye well be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and with boyling make it to resolue verye well, and s√©eing it in boyling too haue caste vp scum, you shall then take it oute of the cauldron, and put it into a tubbe, in the bottome where of, you muste firste haue put fower fingers thicknes of fine sande cleane washed, and that muste be couered with a linnen clothe: and by a littell hoole made in the bottome of the tubbe, you shall suffer it to droppe by littell and littell into some other vessell set vnder to receiue it: &amp; so this water thus strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, you must after put in the verie same or in an other cauldron to boile agayne, and to make the greater parte of the same water, that you put into it s√©ethe awaye: fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally make it boyle so muche, vntill you s√©e it readie to thicken, powering nowe and than, in making it, a littell of the foresayde strong water, and speciallye when it swelleth and casteth vp scum: and this thing (being soo handled) you muste take it oute of the cawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and put it in chestes or other vessells of wood, to congeale: whiche, being a greate quantitie, in thr√©e or fower dayes, you shall finde all that congealed, which will congeale: which, being taken oute, you muste or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as you vsed afore the other: and the same water that is not congealed, muste be boyled agayne: and so you shall doo from time to time as it gathereth together and congealeth: and after this sorte you shall make the Saltepeter moste white and faire, and much better thƒì at the firste s√©ething.</p>
            <p>Also saltepeter is refined in an other manner, whiche is with fire, but in a littell quantitie mynding to doo it well: and although it be a readie waye, yet fewe vse it: albeit it serueth to get oute the fatnes of saltepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:176553:27"/> for that it sendethe into the bottome verye muche yearthynes, notwithstanding I like better the foresaide waye in purging it with water, then this with fire:</p>
            <p>But to doo this, take a salet, or some other yron or brasen vessell, and fill it with Saltpeter, and couer it with a couer of yron, brasse or yearth, soo that it be made bigge inoughe, m√©ete to b√©e taken of and put on when you liste, that the vessell maye be well couered: and then it muste b√©e set in the middest of a good fire of cooles, and so the Saltepeter will melte, whiche is soone perceyued of the experte artificer: but when you thinke that it is molte, looke vpon it: and if it be not well mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, couer it agayne and let it melte well: then it b√©eing well molten, take brimstone mooste finelye beaten in powlder, and strawe some thereon: and if of it selfe it take not fire, doo you kindell it: and being kindeled let it burne till suche time as the brimstone be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, so that nothing ells be burnte, but the vpper parte, and certayne grosse vnctiousnes of the Saltepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the whiche when it is burned, will leaue the reste faire and cleare: and then it muste b√©e taken from the fire letting it coole, where in the vesseell you shall find it (when it shalbe coulde) all in one p√©ece white like vnto a p√©ece of marbell: and all the yearthinesse thereof remayning in the bottome: whiche shalbe good saltepeter to make powlder withall, but not verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to anie other vse: and aboute saltepeter the witte of men haue so muche imagened, that meanes are founde to cause it to growe in the grounde, and in places: that neuer had anie before, by disoluing Salte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter in water: for with the same water wetting the grounde, and letting it stande so a certayne space of time, saltepeter wil be ingendred, so that the same that was put there, will multiplie wonderfully: and it is a moste certayne thing, that in making Saltepeter, the yearthe that hathe b√©ene occupied, heaped vp in a
<pb facs="tcp:176553:28"/> place that is couered, so that the rayne do not washe it, within the space of fiue or sixe yeres, maye agayne b√©e laboured, and Saltpeter shalbe founde to be ingendred, and y√©elde much more, then it dyd the first time: &amp; this that I haue declared in this chapter, is as much as I can saye of Saltpeter.</p>

For that one sorte is occupied for great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and an other sorte for lesse p√©eces: and this is knowen to euerye Bombardier: In Harkabuses, and hande gunnes, is not occupied common pouder, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute certayne fire woorkes: and therefore to euerye of the sayde purposes, the pouders is proporcioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly For that if Serpentine pouder, should be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in hande gunnes, or Harkebuses, it woulde scƒÅt be able to driue their pellettes a quaites caste fr≈ç their mouthes: and if hande gunne pouder shoulde b√©e vsed in p√©eces of ordinaunce, without great discretion, it woulde quickely breake or marre them: and to minde to haue all sorte of pouders good, thr√©e thinges is requisit to b√©e obserued, in making therof. The first is to s√©e, that the substaunce, wherewith it is made, haue no earthie grossenesse. The seconde, that it be finely bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: the thirde, that it b√©e verye well dried, from all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:176553:28"/> humiditie or moistenesse, and this doone, you shall haue strong and excellent good pouder. And it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chiefe thing that is in pouder, is Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for that of it (by the same that is s√©ene) dependeth all the forse. And therefore prouision is to be made, to haue a good quantitie thereof, and that it be cleane and nete: the which by burning, maie well be knowen, for that in all sortes of pouder, it is n√©edefull, that the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter be good.</p>
            <p>Now, for to make common pouder, for greate p√©eces of artillerie there must be taken thr√©e partes, of refined Saltpeter, twoo of Willowe cooles, &amp; one of Brimstone, and grinding euery thing: all muste be well mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; all the moistnesse thereof dried vp, as I haue saide. To make pouder for small p√©eces of artillerye, there muste be taken fiue partes, of refined Saltpeter, and one and a halfe of Cooles, and one of Brimstone, &amp; grinding it moste finelie, and mingling it well together, it muste be corned, and then dried. The maner of corning all sortes of pouder, is with a S√©eue made, with a thicke skinne of Parchemƒìt, full of little round holes, into the whiche S√©eue the pouder muste be put, while it is dancke, and also a little bowle, that when you sifte, it maie roule vp and doune, vpon the clottes of pouder, to breake them, that it maie corne, and runne throughe the hooles of the S√©eue.</p>
            <p>To make Harkebuse and hande Gunne pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there muste be taken tenne partes of refined salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, and one of young hasell cooles of a yeare olde made cleane, and one parte of Brimstone, and beating all in a mortar, or grinding it excedingly well that it maye be mingled together and so fine as is possible, thƒì it muste be corned and throughlie dried. And note that if it be not marueylously well beaten, it wil neuer be good. But because making of pouder, whiche are of thinges that will easylie kindell, cannot be withoute
<pb facs="tcp:176553:29"/> perrill of him that maketh it, excepte it b√©e remedied with wetting: therefore it behoueth to take h√©ede that it be not beaten drie, as well to auoyde suche perrill, as also for that it will be beaten better: for whiche cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it muste be wet with comun water to a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr√©e of moistenes, so that taken vp in ones hande it maye cling together. Some moiste it with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and some, for to make it more stronger, with cƒÅp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hored, <hi>aqua vitae.</hi> When I haue caused gunpouder to b√©e made, I haue vsed comun water, &amp; therefore I am able to saye whiche of those thinges is beste: and to tell my opinion, I doubt whether vineger or, <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the gunpoulder to be any better then the comun water: for as much they vaporyng awaye, as they doo, &amp; as of necessitie they must, I bel√©eue that littell of their substance remayneth.</p>
            <p>There b√©e some whiche in making coole (b√©esides wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) make thƒì of hasell: &amp; some of vyne stickes: &amp; some of baye stickes: some of r√©edes: some of kexses: &amp; to b√©e shorte, all the cooles that are made of softe wood, are of wood which haue much pith: but it is requisit that they be smalle, yong, and tender, and withoute hardenes of knottes: otherwyse they be not good.</p>
            <p>Albeit they be made in diuers maners: but in making of any great quantitie of pouder, the ordinarie coole is to be taken: and makyng a littell, they vse to take yong hasell of a yeare olde, cut in shorte p√©eces, and they putting them into a greate yearthen potte,<note place="margin">Hovve too make coole vvhere vvith gunpoulder is made.</note> or other vessell of yron, or brasse, they shutte it and couer it close, and lute it, or daube it very well aboute, so that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not breathe: and then they make fire rounde aboute it and vpon it, till suche time as it maye b√©e thoughte that the heate is well entred in through all, and that the wood that is within is very well fired: and without fire-brandes, or flame, burned onely through suche heate: and then they take the fire from the potte and let it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:176553:29"/> coole, and so they finde the same wood become cole. I hapning once to haue n√©ede of coles (to thintent to make some quicklie,) toke as manie drie hasel stickes that had their rindes scrapes of, as I thought sufficiente to serue my purpose: and breaking them in p√©eces and laying them close together on a heape, I set them on fire and burned them all well, and then sprinckeled water vpon them with a browne, and with the same wet browme quenched the fire: and so scattered abrode y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> coles h√©ere &amp; there, alwayes sprinckling water vpon thƒì till I quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them: and thus I haue serued my purpose withoute so muche difficultie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is a verie profitable thing, yea and a necessarie, that I declare the maner and facilitie of beating it, for to be able safelie to make a greate quantetie thereof. In olde time they were wonte to grinde gunpouder with certayne handemilles, as they vse to grinde corne, but (besides the paine) it is a waye verie perrillous: for that suche a composition grounde together with stones, will catche heate in suche wyse, that it will soone ingender fire, inespecially euery thing being a matter disposed to fire: as also by rubbing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with violence a couple of baye stickes, you shall straighte waye kendel fire. Some grinde pouder in suche milles as they vse to grinde crabbes or apples to make vargis or sider: and some hath it stamped in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with a water mille or a horsemill, whiche waye is the beste of all other, and moste surest and also it is beaten finelier, and with lesse labour and payne: Some (that hath not the commodetie of water) make a greate wh√©ele, deuised after such sorte, that with the cogges thereof it may raise vp many heauy pestels, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, beate in diuers morters of woodde made in a beame of oke, of the whiche there be some haue the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of brasse.</p>
            <p>Some stampe with their armes, with a greate pestel
<pb facs="tcp:176553:30"/> tied to the ende of a pole with a corde, righte euer a morter of wood or brasse, and so they bease the ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier: other some beate it in a stone morter, with the mouthe some what large, with a wooden pestell, with the handell thereof made like vnto a hammer or a mall. And these, and other, that maye be made, is as much as aboute the deeuise of bealing and making gun pouder is n√©edefull.</p>
            <p>They haue vsed heretofore to waighe euery mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it selfe, and then they haue gone mingling and beating all together: There haue b√©ene after, some that haue deuised to beate euery thing seuerallye by it selfe, and then mingelled altogether and made it. But finally the beste and moste readiesse waye, is to take a quantetie of Saltepeter, wherewith you will make youre poulder, and put it into a catildron with so much water (as being set vpon the fire) maye be thought sufficiente to dissoule it: whiche so sone as it is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, muste be taken of and set on the grounde in a colde place: and the quantetie of beaten coles that is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente, muste be put into it, and so sturring it aboute, muste be mingled well with the Saltpeter dissolued: and then taking youre brimstone finely beaten in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with a staffe stirring aboute the coles and the Saltepeter, you muste strawe it finely vpon the same, as well as you can, with continuall sturring and mingling them together, whiche composition thus made, you muste then drie somewhat in the sunne: and then to haue it excellently well made, there n√©edeth no other to be done, but to beate it alltogether, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente that it maye incorporate moste finely, whiche done, you muste drie it with moste greate diligence: and then si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

They tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And then with a long staffe that hath at the one ende a bob as big as the boolet of the p√©ese, and at the other ende a ladle made for the same purpose that will take so muche pouder vp at twise or thrise, as is aforesayd, the p√©ese must be charged, after this fort. Take the ladle full of pouder, and thrust it into the Gunne so farre as it will go, &amp; then turne your hande with the ladle that the pouder maye fall out &amp; remaine there behinde when you pull out your ladle: whiche done, you muste with the bob ende thereof, thrust the pouder home faire and softelye: and so with the ladle taking vp the rest of the pouder you must doo likewise, and thrust after at the last a wispe of hey or of some thing els, to swepe all the poulder together, and then the bullet whiche muste b√©e of a fit biggnesse for the p√©ese: And also an other wispe to staye the bollet for roling oute: and putting some pouder in the touchehole and aboute the touchchole, the Gunne is then charged.

They saye also, that by meane of this instrument of fire, men cannot vse, nor shewe their strength and vertue, as they might in olde time. And they adde a third thing, that they come with more difficultie to fight a field then they came in those daies, nor their cannot be k√©epte in them the orders of those times, so that at length the warre shalbe broughte to consiste altogether in artillerie.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176553:35"/> to speake concerning their firste opinion, that the auncient Romaine armies shoulde not haue made the conquestes whiche they did, if the ordinaunce had b√©ene in those dayes. To which answering I say, how that warre is made eyther to defende, or to offende.</p>
               <p>Where first it is to be examenid, to whom these twoo maner of warres causeth moste profite, or most hurte. And albeit there is what to say of either part, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I beleue, that withoute comparison, they doo more harme to him that defendeth, thƒì to him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadeth. The reason is, that he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> defendeth, is either in a toune, or in a campe within a trenche. If he be within a toune, this toune is eyther littell, as the moste parte of fortresses are, or it is greate. In the first case, he that defendeth, is altogether loste: for that the violence of the artillerie is suche, that there is no wall, how greate so euer it be, which in few dayes it battereth not doun. And if he that is within, haue not space inoughe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, bothe with diches, and with rampiers, he is ouer come, because he is not abel to withstand the violence of the enemye, whoo throughe the breache of the wall, will after enter: nor in this case, the artillerye whiche he shoulde haue, shall not helpe him: for that this is a generall rule, that where men in a throng, &amp; with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lƒìnce may go, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> artillerie cannot withold them. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the defence of a toune, the furie of the enemies cannot be withstand. Though the assaultes the which are not thronged, but scattered, which be called scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mushes be easelye withstode. And they whiche goo with this disorder, and coldenesse to a breache of a walle, where artillerye is, doo goo to a manifeste deathe, and agaynste them the artillerye preuailethe: but those, which assaulte a breache in a throng harde together, so that the one thrusteth forwarde the other if they be not holden oute of diches, or of rampiers, they enter in euerye place, and the artillerye k√©epeth
<pb facs="tcp:176553:36"/> them not backe, and though some be slaine, they cƒÅnot be so many, that they shall not let the victory. This is knowen to be trew, by many expugnacions of tounes made in Italy, and in especiallie in the same of Bris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia: for as much as the same Towne being rebelled from the frenchemen, and yet the fortresse b√©eing kept for the King of Fraunce, the Venetians for the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the violence, which from the same might come into the toune, had laid all the str√©ete full of Artillerie, which descended from the fortresse to the Citie, &amp; they planted them on the fronte, and in the flanckes, and in euery other fit place. Of the which Mounsier de Fois made no other co≈´pte, but with his squadrons, c≈çming downe on foote passing through the middest of them, gotte the citie: nor it was not knowen that he receiued by those any notable hurte. So that he that defendeth him selfe within a littell Toune (as hath b√©ene sayde) and findeth the walle on the grounde, and hathe not space to retire with rampiers, and with ditches, and is constrayned to truste vpon the artillerye, is ouercome straight way. If thou defendest a great toune, &amp; where thou haste commoditie to retire, yet notwithstanding withoute comparison, the artillerie is more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him which is withoute, then to him that is within. Firste, to minde to haue a p√©ece of Artillerie hurte those without, thou art constrained to gette th√©e vp with it from the playne grounde of the Toune, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause standing vpon the plaine grounde, euery littell bancke and rampier that the enemy maie make, shall cause him to remaine safe, and thou canste not hurts him, so that being driuen to stande a loofte on the toppe of the walle, or in what so euer other maner on highe, thou drawest after th√©e twoo difficulties. The firste is, that thou canste not bring vp so greate and mightye p√©eses of artillerie, as he withoute may shoote, being not able in littell spaces to handell great thinges. The
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176553:36"/> other is, that although thou couldest bring them, thou canst not make such strong &amp; sure defence for to saue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> said artillerie from dismounting, as they without may doo, being on the gro≈´d, and hauing that commoditie &amp; that roome, that they them selues liste. So that it is im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>possible for him that defendeth a toune, to k√©epe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie on high places, when they which are withoute haue greate ordinaunce inough. And if they be driuen to come with thƒì on lowe places, they become for the moste parte vprofitable, as hath bene sayde. So that the defence of the citie, is brought to be defended with armes, as in olde time they did, and with small artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie. Of which if there be gotten a littell profite (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing respecte to the same small artillerie) there is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so much incommoditie, as counterpeaseth the c≈ç<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the artillerie: for as much as hauing res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte to the same, they make the walles of tounes low, and as it were vnder ground in diches, so that so soone as they come to the battaile at hande, eyther because the walles are battered, or because the ditches are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp, he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is within, hath much more disaduantage, then he shoulde haue had in times paste. And therefore (as afore is sayde) these instrumentes helpeth much more him that besiegeth a towne, then he that is besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Concerning the thirde thing, to lye in Campe within a trenche, to the intente not to fighte the fielde but at thy commoditie, or aduauntage, I saye, that in this parte thou hast no more remedy ordinarelie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende th√©e from fighting, then they had in olde time.</p>
               <p>And sometimes, considering the artillerie, thou haste greater disaduauntage: for that if the enemie m√©ete with th√©e, and haue a littell aduauntage of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as may easely chaunce, and finde him selfe higher then thou, or that in his coming thou hast not yet made thy banckes or rampiers, and couered th√©e well with those, straight waye, and before thou haste anie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:176553:37"/> he vnlodgeth th√©e, and thou arte constrayned to issue oute of thy fortresse, &amp; come to fighte: the whiche happened to the Spaniardes in the battaile of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna, whoo being fortefied betwen the riuer of Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and a bancke, because they lay, not so highe as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and for that the Frenchemen had a littell the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage of the grounde, they were constrained of the artillerye to issue oute of their Fortresse, and come to fight. But admit that the place, which thou haste taken with the campe, were muche higher, then the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste it (as for the most part it ought to be) and that the banckes or rampiers were good and sure, so that by meanes of the situacion, and thy other preparacions the enemie durst not assaulte th√©e, it shall come in this case to those maners, which in olde time it came, whƒì one was with his army in place not possible to be hurt: the which are to ouer run the countrie, to take, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege the tounes that are thy friendes, to stoppe th√©e thy victualls, so that thou shalte be constrained of some necessetie to vnlodge, and come to fight the field, where the artillerie (as hereafter shalbe sayde) dooth not muche hurte. Considering then what kinde of warres y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romaines made, and seing how they made almoste all theyr warre to inuade other men, and not for to defende them selues, it shalbe s√©ene (when the thinges sayde afore be trew) how they should haue had more aduauntage, and muche sooner should haue made their conquestes, if ordinaunce had b√©en in those daies. Concerning the seconde thing, that men cannot shew their strength, as they mighte in olde time, because of the artillerye, I saye, that it is trewe, that where men scattered doo shewe it, they stande in more perrill, then in those dayes, when they had to skale a Towne, or to make like assaultes, where men not thronged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but seuerally the one fr≈ç the other did apeare.</p>
               <p>It is also trewe that the Capitaines, and headdes of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176553:37"/> armies, stande more subiecte to the perrill of death: then in those times, because they may be reached with artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie in all places, nor it helpeth not them to b√©e in the rerewardes, garded with moste strong men. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it is s√©ene, that the one and the other of these twoo perrills, doo seldome times extraordinarie hurtes, for that the Tounes well appoincted and furnished with munition are not scaled, nor they goo not with weake assaultes to assaulte them: but minding to winne them, the matter is broughte to a siege, as in olde time they did. And in those, which neuerthelesse are won by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salte, the perrills are not much greater then they were in those daies: for that also in those times, they which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a toune, lacked not thinges to throwe and shoote, the which (though they were not so furius) they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kylling of men the like effecte. Concerning the death of Capitaynes and conducters, there hath b√©en in .xxiiij. yeares that the warre was of late dayes in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, lesse examples, then there was in .x. yeares with the antiquetie: for that excepte Counte Lodouike of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randola, who died at Ferare, whƒì the Venecians, a few yeares agon, assalted the same state, and the Duke of Nemors, which died a Cirignuola, there hath not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the artillery any to be slaine: for as much as Mo≈´<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier de Fois at Rauenna, died of yron, and not of fire.</p>
               <p>So that if men shew not perticularly their strengthes, it groweth not of the artillerie, but of the naughtie orders, &amp; of the weakenes of the armies, the which altogether lacking strength, cannot show it in parte. Cocerning the third thing sayde of them, that men cannot come to hande strokes, and that the warre shalbe brought to stƒÅd altogether vpon artillerie, I saye, that this opinion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together false: and so alwaies shalbe taken of those, who according to the auncient vertue will occupie their armies: for that he that will make a good armie, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him with exercises, eyther fained, or trew, to accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb facs="tcp:176553:38"/> his men to geue the charge on the enemy, and to come to the swordes poincte with him, and to the gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine by the boosome: and he ought to grounde him selfe more vpon the footemen, then vpon the horsemen. And when he shall ground him selfe vpon the footemen, and vpon the foresayde maners, the artillerie becommeth altogether vnprofitable. For that with more facelity, the footemen in aproching n√©ere the enemie, may auoide the shot of the artillery, then they were able in olde time to auoide the violence of Elifants, of cartes full of hookes &amp; of other straunge inco≈´ters, which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romaine foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men incountered withall, against which, alwayes they founde the remedie, and so muche more easelie they should haue found against this, the shorter that the time is, in the which the artillery may hurte th√©e, then the same was, in the which the Elifantes &amp; the cartes were able to hurte: for as much as they in the middest of the fighte, disordered men, these onelye before the fighte doo trouble men: the which impediment the footemen ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auoide, either with gowing couered by the nature of the situacion, or with falling downe vpon the grounde, whƒì they shoote: the which also by experience hath b√©ens s√©ene not to be needefull, in especially to be defended fr≈ç greate ordinaunce, the which cannot in such wyse be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, because if they gowe highe, they touche th√©e not, &amp; if they gow lowe, they will not come n√©ere th√©e. Then the armies being come to hande strokes, this is more cleare, then the lighte, that neyther the greate, nor the littell can after hurt th√©e: for that if the same, which hath the artillery, be before, it becommeth thy prisoner, if it behind, it hurteth the friende before th√©e. Againe on the backe it cannot hurte thee after such sorte, that thou art not able to gow to winne it, and it commeth to follow the sayd effect. Nor this nede not much disputacion: for that there hath bene s√©ene the example of the Suizers, whoo at Nauara in the yere of our Lorde .1513. without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176553:38"/> artillerie, and withoute horse, wente to incounter the Frenche army furnished with artillery within their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, and they ouerthrew thƒì withoute hauing any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment thereby: and the reason is (besides the thinges told afore) that the artillerie mynding to haue it worke, hath n√©ede to be garded eyther of a wall, or of ditches, or of banckes. And when it lacketh one of these gardes, it is taken, or becommeth vnprofitable, as it happeneth when it is defended with men, for when they chaunce to be in a battaile, and in the fight on the lande, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be occupied by flanke, but in the same maner, that the antiquitie occupied the instrumentes to shoote, which they placed oute of the squadrons, for that they shoulde fight out of the orders, and alwayes whƒì eyther of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or of other they were charged vpon, their refuge was behinde the legions: he that otherwise maketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte of them, hath no skill, and trusteth vpon a thing, which easely may deceyue him. And though the Turke by meanes of artillerie, against the Sophi and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, hath had victory, it hath not happened through other meanes, then through the feare that the horsemen were put in by the straunge rumor thereof. Therefore to make an ende of this discourse, I c≈çclude, that the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie is profitable in an army, when the auncient vertue is mingled therewith, but withoute the same, against a puisant army, it is moste vnprofitable.</p>

               <p>There is also founde of it that is rodde, as in <hi>Apulia,</hi> where there is greate quƒÅtetie, and that they call Boale, and is the very same that some Apoticares doo sell for Boale Armenick, &amp; the Venecians vse of it, for to paint redde the forefrontes of their houses with lime, bricke, and Vermillion, couering it afterwarde with oyle of line. This redde earth is the fattest, and the clammiest of all the rest, and therefore it cleaueth soonest by the fire, if it be not tempered with some other substance. And because that all the sayde earthes be to fatte, the one more than the other, therefore menne put to them some leane substaunce. Nowe, if you take of that of ashe coloure, whiche is moste commen, and the least fatty, you maye compose and make it in this maner. Take of the saide earth foure partes, of cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers floxe or shearing, one part, ashes that haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in a buck, or other, halfe a parte, drie horse dung, or the dung of an Asse, one part.

By this meane you shall haue a very good claye, for to lute or clay, and ioyne violles, flagons of glasse to still with, and bottels of gourdes for stilling, and other great thinges, as fournesses and such like. But he that wil make it with more ease, let him put the earth onely, the floxe, and the horse dong, with a fewe ashes. Some put no horse dong to it, and some no floxe, according to the purpose that they make it for. For to stop and close vp the mouthes of stilling glasses, or violles, to the intent they take no vent on the fire, the sayde clay will be very good: neuerthelesse men put to it twoo partes of quicke lime, and the whites of Egges, and then it will be surer to let nothing vent oute but the glasse it selfe. All kinde of clay or earth would b√©e k√©ept moiste, and r√©edy dressed for him that will occupye it continually, but it must not b√©e kept to watery, nor yet left to drie, for then it would serue for nothing, s√©eing that after it is once hardened, a man can not dresse it any more to do any good withall.</p>
